== Risks and Technical Debts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form
List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/[Risks and Technical Debt] in the arc42 documentation.

****
Identifying potential risks helps mitigate the challenges that the project could have. That's
why this analysis is crucial for the project's success. Other benefits of this recognition
are the enhancement of project efficiency, reduce rework, and ensure a good software product
for our stakeholders and users.

=== Technical risks

| Risk | Description | Mitigation

| WikiData Service
| Relying on this external API can cause the QuestionService to stop working and produce our WebApp to not even be playable.
| Introduce a sort of Cache for questions. When questions are generated from this API, try to store them for later usage or even to improve performance. 

| Microsoft Translation Service
| Same issue as Wikidata, the failure on this API or the suspension from this API to our Application can make our questions to never be translated, although in the frontend there is a way of changing the language display.
| The team has read all restrictions of its Free tier and made "tricks" to minimize the impact of failure such as transforming question arrays into a single string
to avoid the rate limit (1000 requests/hr) 

| Inexperience
| The little knowdlege about new tecnologies used in the project like React, Express or Docker; can cause a failure in the implementation of it.
| Research and constant learning through development can lead to better understanding of the technologies.

=== Business risks

| Risk | Description | Mitigation

| Reponse times
| Having to wait for API responses can cause serious Bottlenecks on the WebApp. Users wpuld have to wait long time for each game they want to play.
| The usage of asynchronus calls can be very beneficial for this risk to be mitigated.  

| Deadlines
| Time constraints tied to the constant delivery of features can lead to not ending with the required project features.
| Team must organize itself well to meet all requirements. Also, continuous team meetings will be carried out to keep in touch with each team member work.

=== Technical debts

| Debt | Description

| Azure
| The decision of using this platform is fully based on the team's knowdlege. Although, it could not be the best option/approach since other platforms such as AWS or hosting ones can have other benefits. 

| Game Logic
| The decision of having our game logic like controlling the points, time played by player, etc; in
the Frontend part may seem a good option when trying to develop a game quickly. Although, it is possible
to add to a single user more points than it should be through programs like POSTMAN, so a backend game
logic could tackle this issue.
