== Building Block View
 
=== Whitebox Overall System

image::05_Overall_System.png["Overall System"]

Motivation::

The diagram above shows the high-level abstraction of the functionality
of the system. As it can be seen, there are two main 
components: Users and Application; and one External service: Wikidata.
The general workflow consists on a series of interactions done by the users through
the different components exposed by the Application. During the game, the application
will require the help of the external service to generate the different questions
and answers that the user will have to choose.

| **Building block** | **Description** 
| Saber y Ganar Application | The core block that manages the game itself and the visuals of it.

=== Level 2: Application

Here display with Mermaid the image that we have on Discord. The one that
shows in more detailed Black Box "Saber y Ganar Application" 

Motivation::

A little bit of description of the workflow or why this division have been performed.

Contained Building Blocks::

|===
| **Building block** | **Description** 
| WebApp | Component that Users interact with. It represents all the visuals and interactivity of the Web Application.
| Gateway | MiddleWare that connects the WebApplication with the different MicroServices of the Application.
| AuthService | It manages all the actions referred to the authentication of a user into the system. Also, the different registration of them.
| UserService | It manages all the acions referred to the users such as retrieval of game history.
| QuestionService | Handles the Question and Answers generation. This action is complemented with the use of Wikidata API.

=== Level 3

I'm really not sure of what to go deep into detail. :/

Perhaps, we can do in Level2: user > Frontend > Gateway > MicroServices
and then in Lefel 3: Open the MicroServices Blackbox to explain AuthService, UserService and Question Service
