== Cross-cutting Concepts

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* models, especially domain models
* architecture or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of an overarching (= cross-cutting) nature
* implementation rules


.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture. 
Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks, e.g. security or safety. 


.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== User Experience (UX)

==== Internationalization

One of the things to increase accessibility is giving our application the
capability of being in various languages so people around the world can play
our game. Obviously, internationalization is more than just changing the 
language of the Application but due to time constraints we will just offer 
Spanish, English, Ukrainian and French languages ( although, our API can generate questions
in other languages different from described, to see the whole list, refer to 
our https://kawgame.xyz:8000/api-doc[API documentation] ).

The library used for language translation in our KaW game is called 
https://react.i18next.com/[*react-i18next*]. 
For simplicity (and due to just only having three languages), all of the translations
of messages are stored locally in properties files. Eventually, if the Application
grows and we wanted to  have more than 4 languages the best approach is to
store those properties in a server and let the application to request
those on the fly. Again, for simplicity the option of having all bundle
together in the Frontend just fits.

The translation of questions is a bit different from the frontend part since it
is done "on the fly" by using the 
https://rapidapi.com/microsoft-azure-org-microsoft-cognitive-services/api/microsoft-translator-text[Microsoft translation API] 
. This change has been done since the questions are not fully known until they are generated
so storing the translation locally does not provide any benefit. Also, one advantage of it, is its 
simplicity and ease to use. To meet the restrictions impose by the Free version of this API a series 
of formatting rules are carried out into the question generation phase to minimize the usage of it
and avoid getting suspended.



=== Security

==== Bcrypt

Keeping a secure website for our users is one of our main quality
goals. For that, all the passwords stored in MongoDB are simply
hashes so attackers cannot decipher them easily. The library used
in the AuthService and UserService to store or compare passwords
is called *bcrypt*. This library provides with an easy way
to hash passwords and keep user's data secured.

Also, all users are enforced to have a password with at least 8
characters. This security measure makes a lot of sense if we 
want to really ensure the security of our users. Although 
sometimes it could be a bit cumbersome for some, the introduction 
of this measure make security to grow exponentially.

==== Authentication

To keep our users' data secure an authentication mechanism has
been developed with the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT). If someone
tries to access historical game records for certain users, our
KaW application enforces to pass a valid token through the header
of the message request.

In this way, only authenticated users are able to consult the
different data that our application enforces.

==== Other security aspects

As stated in the quality goals, the security plays a crucial role
in our application to prevent any attacks from external users or
any potential backdoors that we could have in our code. 

For that, a Static Application Security Testing (known also as SAST) tool
is included into our project. This tool scans the source code of our application 
for security weaknesses, potential vulnerabilities, and coding patterns that 
could lead to security breaches. One famous service that implements a SAST is
SonarCloud, so the team has decided to use this tool in our CI and CD environment
so each time a change is uploaded, the security scanner checks for any issue.

=== Development concepts

==== Test

Testing is one important feature when development comes to the table. To keep
a good CI and CD environment a series of tests are enforced before submitting
any new change into our main pipeline project. GithubActions help us to achieve
this goal where different workflows have been built to ensure a project with
the highest quality standards.

There are many different types of tests and the team has decided to enforce the
following ones:

- Unitary Testing (included on CI/CD): 

Each new code is tested independently to ensure its correct
functionality and not breaking the main project. The testing framework used both 
for Backend and Frontend is https://jestjs.io/[Jest] due to its simplicity and its great bound with
Javascript files. 

Also, the usage of SonarCloud gives us more than security checking,
it also enforces each member of the team to have a good coverage on our code to meet
the quality standards we are required.

- End-to-End Testing (included on CI/CD):

Apart from testing functionality, all our code must also meet the required
domain functionality such as registration, login, etc. For that, Jest is used
in combination with https://pptr.dev/[puppeteer] which provides a High-level API
to control browsers and simulate our different User Stories (domain functionality)
that the project requires.

The following functional requirements have been tested:

[circle]
* LOGIN-1: Registered user logs in successfully
* LOGIN-2: Registered user logs in with incorrect password
* PROFILEMGT-1: User updates profile information (profile picture and bio)
* REGISTER-1: The user is not registered in the site
* REGISTER-2: The user is already registered in the site
* GAME-1: The user wants to go to the game menu
* GAME-2: The user wants to start an easy game
* GAME-3: The user wants to start a medium game
* GAME-4: The user wants to start a hard game

The combination of both Unitary and End-to-End tests gives our Application 
with enough robustness to meet the expectations of delivering high quality
code. 

- Load Testing:

Although our application may not have a huge load of users, one of the quality
goals is the performance of the application. With load testing, the team will be
able to identify certain aspects or cases in which code takes too long to execute
things. For example, having a lot of users playing the game and making a lot
of requests to generate questions.

For that, https://gatling.io/[Gatling] was chosen as our main load testing framework. Although, it is
not written in Javascript which could facilitate the configuration, Gatling offers
a light and simple framework to build these kind of tests. Also,the files
generated by it are Java files which eases the tasks due to the vast knowledge of
the team on this programming language.

To see a real workload and how our application behaves to it, it has been carried two different
tests per each case scenario. The first one could be consider a "considerable" amount of
users where 20 users arrive to the application per second during 60 seconds. The second one
is a type of load testing called Stress testing where the Application is put at its maximum
capacity so it breaks. The following results are provided below:

[circle]
* LOGIN:
** https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_en3b/gatling/LogInConsiderable/index.html[Considerable]
** https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_en3b/gatling/LogInStress/index.html[Stress]
* REGISTER:

* PROFILECHANGES:

** https://arquisoft.github.io/wiq_en3b/gatling/HardGameStress/index.html[Stress]

As it can be seen, the Application runs smoothly with 1200 concurrent users and it is
more than enough to meet the quality requirements and taking in mind where the Application
is hosted. On the other hand, it is currently impossible to achieve availiability and
performance if 3000 users use our Application.

If more information is needed on how to run those tests, please go 
https://github.com/Arquisoft/wiq_en3b/blob/master/webapp/GatlingLT/gettingOurHandsOn.md[here].

- Usability testing

Finally, another crucial part to be tested in our application are usability ones.
With these test, the team tries to deliver high quality functionality to the
users by simply testing with them and examine its behaviour.

The team will select different people to try our application to get Information
on how to improve it, at the end, this application is for them!

[circle]
* Home page:
  As stated by many users, they were a little bit lost when logging in directly into
  the application since they have to "guess" where the play button was (it was in navbar).
  For that, the team decided to include a direct play button that takes the user to the
  Game Page. Also, after checking with contrast tools, the name displayed on the Home
  Page was not readable enough, so it was also changed.

image::HomePage_Old.png[OldHomePage,640,480]

image::HomePage_Change.png[NewHomePage,640,480]

[circle]
* Game modes:
  Another thing the team noticed is the difficulty of users to select one game mode from
  our Game since they did not what did it mean "Easy", "Medium", ... So the team decided
  to put a descriptive text in each of the game modes so the user can truly understand
  what challengue is facing.

image::Game_Old.png[OldGamePage,640,480]

image::Game_Change.png[NewGamePage,640,480]

[circle]
* Password fields
  Some users have been very frustated when registering/logging into our Application
  since there was no "See password" button to correct their mistakes when typing. Since
  this is a simple yet powerful change to improve the User Experience, the team has decided
  to also support that capability. 

image::Password_Old.png[OldPasswordPage,640,480]

image::Password_Change.png[NewPasswordPage,640,480]

Usability testing does not ends here since it is needed a real one with lots of users
of different ages and also, taking into account its timing on completing certain tasks.
Although, taking already care of these details makes really the difference. 


- Accesibility, color checker and more

Google's automated tool LightHouse is used to perform several of "cross-cutting" tests to 
improve the performance and correctness of our web Application.

It has been tested each page of our Application against this tool to see any flaw 
into our application, and, as it can be seen, our game has a very good mark on each one:

==== Code generation

===== JSend

To have an standardized way of responses for the different Microservices that our
application have, the JSend specification has been chosen. This specification allows
the team to have uniform JSON responses so other parts of the system such as
Frontend, always know what to expect from these services. 


=== Architecture and design patterns

==== MicroServices

The reason behind, is that with Microservices architecture we can forget about dealing
with a single complex application. Instead, we make a "Divide and Conquer" approach by 
identifying those modules that made up our system and making it independently deployable 
services, each serving a specific business function.

==== Gateway and REST

This architectural pattern makes it easier for the Frontend subsystem to communicate 
with the different MicroServices that composes our Application since it has to focus
on a single entry point instead of knowing which service to consult. It also help us 
to tackle the requirement of APIs by using this pattern since it acts like a REST API where
other users (not our Application) can make petitions to it to retrieve some data using 
a uniform interface.

    g<--"saveHistory"-->m
    g<--"newGame"-->m
    g<--"..."-->m
....


=== "Under-the-hood" concepts

==== Persistence

As stated in point 4.1, the chosen database for the project is MongoDB 
which offers us a document-oriented schema. This type of database fits
perfectly with our services since the mainly work with JSON-formatted data. 

===== ER model - QuestionDatabase

[mermaid]
....
erDiagram
    
    QUESTION_TEMPLATE ||--|| QUESTION_TYPE:has

    QUESTION {
        String question
        Object[] answers
        int correctAnswerId
        String image
        String type
    }
    
    QUESTION_TEMPLATE{
        String questionTemplate
    }
    
    QUESTION_TYPE{
        String name
        String query
        String[] entities
        String typeName
    }
....

|===
| Document | Description 
| QUESTION_TEMPLATE
| Holds the template needed to query the WikiData API for the Question generation. It
has a relation with *ONE QUESTION_TYPE* document.
| QUESTION_TYPE
| Represents a category for a question (e.g. Capitals) together with its SPARQL query.
Also, several entities are provided so prior to send SPARQL query into Wikidata Service, it
can be selected one entity to change the whole query (e.g. Capitals of Europe or Capitals of Asia)
| QUESTION
| Holds document of already generated questions. This schema is used for performance enhancements
(for a simple yet powerful cache)
|===

===== ER model - UserDatabase

[mermaid]
....
erDiagram
    
    USER ||--|| USER_HISTORY:has
    USER ||--|| USER_PROFILE:has

    USER {
        String username
        String password
        Date createdAt
    }

    USER_HISTORY {
        int passedQuestions
        int wrongQuestions
        int gamesPlayed
        int timesPlayed
        int points
    }

    USER_PROFILE{
        String bio
        String pic
    }
....

|===
| Document | Description 
| USER 
| Holds all the data related to a user registered into our game. It
has a relation with *ONE USER_HISTORY* and *ONE USER_PROFILE* document
| USER_HISTORY
| Holds all the records/statistics of a single user through all played games.
| USER_PROFILE
| Holds specific customization of the profile of a user.
|===

===== Connection to MongoDB

To make it easier the connection from Services (using ExpressJS) to MongoDB, the
usage of *Mongoose* has been chosen. This is a JS library that help us to create these 
connections. 

[mermaid]
....
flowchart LR
    subgraph back [Backend]
        subgraph micro [MicroServices]
            as("fa:fa-user-cog" 
            AuthService)
            us("fa:fa-user-cog" 
            UserService)
            qs("fa:fa-gamepad" 
            QuestionService)
        end
        m1("fa:fa-book
        Mongoose Schema")
        m2("fa:fa-book
        Mongoose Schema")
        subgraph mongo [MongoDB]
            ud("fa:fa-database" 
            UserDatabase)
            td("fa:fa-database" 
            QuestionDatabase)
        end
    end
    as <--> m1 <--> ud
    us <--> m1 
    qs <--> m2 <--> td
....

==== Session handling

To handle the different sessions of our different users, JWT are also used
for this purpose. For each logged in user, a token will be generated for
authenticating them as stated previously, and also, for maintaining a session
and hold the necessary information without having to reenter the users' credentials.
In this way, the user will have to keep on its browser this token to maintain
alive the session.

=== Operation concepts

==== Monitoring with Grafana & Prometheus

To provide with quality to the Application, a monitoring system has been applied using
Grafana and Prometheus,to always keep track of how the application is performing. The 
work is simple, it has been added Prometheus to "scrap" information from the Gateway Service
like all the petitions it is asked to it.

This information is available at kawgame.xyz:8000/metrics and the Prometheus application,
that manages it, at kawgame.xyz:9091. Although, this is retrieval is good, for the "humans"
is not so comfortable to the "eye". For that, Grafana has been set up.

This application help us to see in a graphical way all the load that our Application is
having and how it responds to it. As this is "developers" information, a login has been set
up to prevent other people from knowing this information.

In that way, we would have the following:

[mermaid]
....
sequenceDiagram
    Gateway->>Prometheus: GET /...
    Gateway->>Prometheus: POST /...
    Gateway->>Prometheus: ... 
    Prometheus->>+Grafana: Send information
    actor u as Devs
    Grafana-->>-u: Display graphs
....

==== Persisting the Persistence

As requested by our shareholders, the application needed to keep all data from previous
deployments. For that, the team has decided to have a simple yet powerful solution with
the usage of Volumes of Docker. 

With this approach, each container from the Infrastructure shown before has its own data
stored in those Volumes and it is also independent from it, so any new release will use
the previous data and "persist the persistence".
