== Building Block View

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image::05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.

Motivation::

The diagram above shows the high-level abstraction of the functionality
of the system. As it can be seen, there are two main 
components: Users and Application; and one External service: Wikidata.
The general workflow consists on a series of interactions done by the users through
the different components exposed by the Application. During the game, the application
will require the help of the external service to generate the different questions
and answers that the user will have to choose. Also, users can communicate with
our API to retrieve or generate information to be used in other applications.

| **Building block** | **Description** 
| KaW Application | The core block that manages the game itself, the visuals of it and the API interface.
| WikiData | API that offers the Application an easy-to-use interface to perform queries for the question and answer generation.

Motivation::

In this level of decomposition, we illustrate the primary services of our system. The Frontend 
service serves as the entry point for user interactions with the KaW game, 
directing them to the Gateway. The Gateway then routes these interactions to the appropriate 
microservices for processing. The users can also make direct requests to the Gateway to communicate
with our API instead that playing the game. This diagram emphasizes the flow of interactions through the 
system's components.


Contained Building Blocks::

| **Building block** | **Description** 
| Frontend | Service responsible for collecting user interactions and routing them to the Gateway.
| Gateway | Middleware component that routes user interactions or API requests to the appropriate microservices.
| Microservices | Collection of smaller services responsible for handling various functionalities of the application.

Motivation::

This diagram shows a more detailed view of the functionality
of the system, showing the gateway and the different microservices.
The user interacts with the WebApp, which sends requests to the Gateway. 
The Gateway then communicates with the different microservices to perform various operations. 
The QuestionService also interacts with the Wikidata API to generate questions and answers. 
The results are then sent back to the user through the same path. 
This architecture allows for a separation of concerns, where each component has a specific role and responsibility.

If users decide to use the API, they must always connect through our Gateway and never directly to
the services itself. Having this in mind, users can make requests to generate questions (the same
way as we use for our game) for its own purposes and also, consult a series of historical records
of the game itself such as games played, questions failed, etc.

| **Building block** | **Description** 
| WebApp | Component that Users interact with. It represents all the visuals and interactivity of the Web Application.
| Gateway | MiddleWare that connects the WebApplication with the different MicroServices of the Application and serves as an API entrance point.
| AuthService | It manages all the actions referred to the authentication of a user into the system. Also, the different registration of them.
| UserService | It manages all the actions referred to the users such as retrieval of game history.
| QuestionService | Handles the Question and Answers generation. This action is complemented with the use of Wikidata API.
