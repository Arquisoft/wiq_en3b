== Architecture Constraints


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/[Architecture Constraints] in the arc42 documentation.

The development of the application has several architectural constraints that must be addressed.

=== Technical constraints

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Constraint|Explanation
| Web front-end | The application must be accessible through a web interface to interact with the game.
| Data storage | The application must be able to store historical data from users (number of games, questions, etc.) and allow them to register.
| Wikidata | Wikidata will be used to generate the questions, so the application must implement mechanisms to fetch information from it.
| Deployment | The application will be deployable on a Linux server.
|===

=== Organizational constraints

[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Constraint|Explanation
| Team members | The team is composed of 7 members from the same lab team.
| Time | The application is developed in a limited time (the semester).
| Meetings | At least one meeting per week will have place in order to discuss what needs to be done next.
| Git | The developement team must use git for version control management.
|===

=== Conventions
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|Constraint|Explanation
| Language | All the project must be developed in English.
| ARC42 | The documentation of the project must use the ARC42 template.
| GitHub conventions | Changes in the project must be carried out by using different branches. Issues are used as official communication means.
| OpenAPI | The APIs documentation will follow https://www.openapis.org/[OpenAPI specification] to have an standarized way of documenting and make it easier for the users consulting it.
| JSend | All services must follow the https://github.com/omniti-labs/jsend[JSend] specification for each JSON response.
