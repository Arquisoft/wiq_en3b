== System Scope and Context


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners
(neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

.Motivation
The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

.Form
Various options:

* Context diagrams
* Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/[Context and Scope] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Introduction

The KaW project aims to develop a new experimental version of the Saber y Ganar quiz show for RTVE, led by the software development company HappySw. This project involves creating a web application where users can register, log in, and participate in quiz games. Questions for the quiz will be automatically generated from data available in Wikidata.

=== Business Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Specification of *all* communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces.
Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

.Motivation
All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

.Form
All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table.
The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

|===
|Communication partner|Inputs|Outputs
| User | Interacts with WebApp by putting user credentials and answering to questions. | Receives question status (correct/incorrect) and history information about past games.
| WebApp | User interaction by means of a graphical interface. This includes accepting the answers of questions. | Provides user information and question data including text, options and the correct answer.
| Question Service | Accepts queries for generating questions based on size, type and language. | Generates the question data (text, options, images and correct answer).
| Wikidata | Receives queries from the Question Service in order to generate the data of the question. | Responds to the queries with all the data of the generated question.

=== Technical Context

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

| Component | Description
| WebApp | Accessible via the internet, allowing users to interact with the KaW application. 
| Services | Provide access to user information and generated questions, enabling integration with external systems. Also, provides an API interface for consulting certain information.
| Database | Stores and retrieves user data, including registration information and participation history. Also, questions can be stored for caching purposes. 
| Wikidata | Accepts SPARQL queries and returns the requested data about questions.
