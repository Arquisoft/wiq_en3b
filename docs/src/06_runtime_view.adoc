== Runtime View


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...

=== Login scenario

When the user wants to login into the application (KaW), the user navigates to the login page. 
The WebApp will show a form that allows the user to enter their details (username and password), 
which are then sent to the User Service by means of the Gateway in order to be verified. 

Then, the User Service asks the Database for the password given the username. The Database 
will return an encrypted password. The User Service will encrypt the password provided by 
the user and then compare it with the one from the database. If the passwords do not match, 
an error message showing "Invalid credentials" will appear to the user, and if they are 
correct, a valid JSON response is created together with the creation of a session token that
allows the user to stay authenticated for a period of time. Finally the user will be able to access the application.

This case scenario is also represented on the following diagram:

    actor User as User
    
    User->>WebApp: Enters details (username, password)
    WebApp->>Gateway: Sends user details
    Gateway->>User Service: Sends user details
    User Service->>UserDatabase: Asks for encrypted password by username
    UserDatabase-->>User Service: Responds with the encrypted password of the user
    User Service-->User Service: Tests if passwords are equal after encryption
    alt Credentials are incorrect
        User Service-->>Gateway: Sends error message "Invalid credentials"
        Gateway-->>WebApp: Sends error message "Invalid credentials"
        WebApp-->>User: Displays error message "Invalid  credentials"
    else Credentials are correct
        User Service-->>Gateway: Creates JWT token and sends success response.
        Gateway-->>WebApp: Sends success response.
        WebApp-->>User: Displays the HomePage.
    end
....


=== Question Generation

When a user starts a game through the WebApp, it triggers a request for generating questions to 
the Gateway. The Gateway works with the QS (Question Service) to generate questions. To improve 
performance a simple cache system is implemented.

First, half of questions to generate are actually generated using Wikidata Service: QS requests a 
question template from the Database, which is then filled with relevant data from the 
WQS (Wikidata Query Service). After filling the template, QS uses the previous data, obtained 
from WQS, to also generate answers and distractors. If WQS gets timed out (e.g. waiting more 
than 5 sec to retrieve the data to fill template), it is chosen an already generated question from
cache to always try to return the exact number of questions requested.

Second, the other half are simply retrieved from previosuly wikidata generated questions which are
stored in DB. Then, both array of questions are combined to return the n questions requested.

Optionally, if questions are required in a certain language. The QS queries a translation Service
(TS) to perform the translation. For that, the whole array of questions is transformed into a 
suitable string format to avoid constraints by TS (e.g. translating question by question and answer
by answer). Then, TS is used and translates the string. Once this is done, QS is in charge of
reformatting the translated string into questions array. 

Finally, QS sends them back to the Gateway, so again the response can then be redirected 
towards the WebApp. Finally, the WebApp displays the questions of the game.

This case scenario is also represented with the following diagrams (splitted for better understanding).

Overview of Question Generation workflow:

    actor U as User
    participant FE as WebApp 
    participant BE as Gateway 
    participant QGS as Question Service

    U->>FE: Starts a Game
    FE->>BE: Requests n Questions (optionally, language)
    BE->>QGS: Generate Questions

    QGS-->QGS: Question generation phase

    QGS-->QGS: Caching retrieval phase    

    QGS-->QGS: Combine both phases (N questions) 

    alt Translation phase
        QGS-->QGS: Translate question into given language
    end
    
    QGS-->>BE: Return Questions
    BE-->>FE: Return Questions
    FE->>U: Display Questions
....

The Question Generation phase consists of:

    participant DB as QuestionDatabase 

    loop for each question in N/2 questions
        QGS->>DB: Request Question Template
        DB-->>QGS: Return Question Template
        QGS->>WQS: Request Data
        WQS-->>QGS: Return Data
        QGS-->QGS: Fill Template
        QGS-->QGS: Generate Answer + Distractors
        QGS-->QGS: Create Question
    end
....

The caching retrieval phase:

    loop for each question in N/2 questions
        QGS->>DB: Request Question
        DB-->>QGS: Return Question
    end
....



If a language has been selected, the translation phase will be as follows:
[mermaid]

    alt Questions generated in a language
        QGS-->QGS: Transform questions array into string
        QGS->>TS: Make string translation to language
        TS-->>QGS: Return string translation
        QGS-->QGS: Transform string into array questions
    end
    
....

=== User statistics recording scenario

When a user answers a question, the WebApp determines if the answer was correct or not. Then, 
that data is sent to the Gateway and then forwarded to the User Service, which is in charge of 
updating the Database with the updated user history. This process is repeated for each answer to 
a question.

Once the user answer the final question of the game, appart from doing the beforementioned process,
the user history is also updated with the game "highlights" such as time spent playing.

This case scenario is also represented on the following diagram:

    FE-->FE: Determines if the answer is correct
    FE->>BE: Indicates correctness of the answer
    BE->>HS: Save the user history
    HS->>DB: Updates the user history

    U->>FE: Answers final Question
    FE-->FE: Determines if the answer is correct
    FE->>BE: Indicates correctness of the answer and end of game.
    BE->>HS: Save the user history with other endgame statistics.
    HS->>DB: Updates the user history
