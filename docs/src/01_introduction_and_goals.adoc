=== Quality Goals

[cols="1,1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Priority | Quality Goal | Description | Considerations

| 1
| Usability
| As with any application, response time, learning curve, and navigability of the application should meet standards and expected minimums. The system should be easy to use and not require specific or complex knowledge. | Consider incorporating user feedback and usability testing to refine the user interface.

| 2
| Availability
| The application must be accessible 24 hours a day. While complete availability may be impossible over extended periods, minimizing downtime and making interruptions imperceptible to users is key. | Implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms can help ensure continuous availability.

| 3
| Security
| The application should adhere to industry best practices for security to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other threats. | Regular security audits and implementing basic security controls are essential.

| 4
| Maintainability
| The application should demonstrate good architecture and design to showcase the team's capabilities and ensure easy maintenance. | Documenting code and following best practices contribute to maintainability.

| 5
| Privacy
| Users must be assured that their personal information is protected when using the application. | Implementing basic data protection measures and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations enhance privacy.

| 6
| Performance
| The software should have acceptable response time to provide a smooth user experience. | Basic optimization techniques can improve performance.

| 7
| Efficiency
| Application functionalities should be efficient for users to accomplish their tasks effectively. | Streamlining workflows and minimizing redundant processes contribute to efficiency.

| 8
| Testability
| The application must be designed to facilitate testing across various scenarios to ensure robustness and reliability. | Implementing basic testing frameworks and writing unit tests support testability.

| 9
| Adaptability
| The application should adapt seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes. While primarily developed for desktops, it should also provide a satisfactory user experience on mobile devices. | Utilizing responsive design principles and conducting compatibility testing across devices can enhance adaptability.
