== Introduction and Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations
****

RTVE wants to offer a web application based on the famous Spanish TV show 
https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber_y_ganar["Saber y Ganar"] 
to its users in commemoration of the 28th anniversary of the show. This show consists on
answering a number of questions with different types and subjects obtaining a prize for 
each question well answered.

The expected goal is to offer a well-designed game that maintains all the quality standards
that the company offers like maintainability, security, etc...; while trying to fulfill the
user's needs to provide a positive UX.   

=== Requirements Overview

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

****

The web application must meet the following requirements:

|===
| Requirement | Description  
| User Registration and Login | Users must be able to register into game or login into the game.
| WikiData | The questions and answer options (a correct one and three distractors) must be generated using the WikiData API.
| Timer | All the questions must have a time to answer.
| APIs | The game must expose two APIs that retrieves information about 1. Users and 2. Questions generated. 
| User History | Maintain a record of users' participation in the game, including the number of games played, questions passed and failed, and times played.

=== Quality Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
****

[cols="1,1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Priority | Quality Goal | Description | Considerations

| 1
| Usability
| As with any application, response time, learning curve, and navigability of the application should meet standards and expected minimums. The system should be easy to use and not require specific or complex knowledge. 
| Consider incorporating user feedback and usability testing to refine the user interface.

| 2
| Accessibility
| Any user must be able to enjoy playing with our application despite any disability they could have.
| HTML standards must be followed to try to minimize the lack of Accessibility of our Application. Another important feature is the contrast of our web. All of these can be tested with Accessibility tools available on Internet.

| 3
| Performance
| The software should have acceptable response time to provide a smooth user experience. | Basic optimization techniques can improve performance.

| 4
| Security
| The application should stick to industry best practices for security to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other threats.
| Regular security audits and implementing basic security controls are essential.

| 5
| Availability
| Minimizing downtime and making interruptions imperceptible to users is desirable, however, it is difficult to achieve and not a strict requirement. For a game application, continuous availability is not crucial.
| Implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms can enhance availability.

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
