  // Ra√∫l
  // With this query I can consistently get several tourists attractions/famous places from a country.
  // There are a few things to consider:
  // Some entities may not have an associated label, making it so what is returned is not a name but an 
  // entity in format QXXXXXX. If this happens we will probably need to cancel the creation of the question.
  // We could try to obtain more attractions, but the time to perform the query becomes unfeasible.
  // I could also make it so that several countries are considered. However, it becomes much less consistent.
  // Also, there are countries which do not return any attractions.
  // If we want to generate the question, in this case one query will not be enough.
  // We need to decide what to do:
  // We can do more simple things for now, since this is just the first prototype.
  // We can try to modify the Question Model or find a new way to approach the problem to try manage this type of cases.
  // We could also forget this specific question and go on, but we will probably encounter similar problems
  // in the future.
  // IMPORTANT: Probably there is a better approach for the query below, but with mi current knowledge of 
  // the Wikidata Query Service, I don't know which it's.
